Some names for variables are legal and some are illegal. The following are a few rules to follow to create a legal variable name.

The variable name cannot start with a number
The variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
The variable name can only contain letters, numbers, and the underscore character
Variable names are case sensitive
The variable name should not have a space if there are two words to the name

If I were to create a variable to hold the name of a student some of the variable names I would use are:
Name
Student_name
name
_name
student
A few bad examples of variable names are:
name*
Student name
Name of student
Student-name
